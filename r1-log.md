## Log

### R1D1 
I updated my VA Breweries project. Worked on adding functional pagination buttons. Struggled with making it work with a seach input, but I figured it out.

### R1D2
I continued to work on my VA Breweries project. I added another button to search for breweries on google maps and added a dropdown for sorting listings by name, city, and type. So far, I have the sortByName function working for a single page. I need to figure out how to keep the listings sorted when navigating to other pages.

### R1D3
I figured out how to keep the brewery listings sorted by name, city, and/or type when navigating to other pages. I think I might eventually add another page to see all breweries on a map.

## R1D4
I started an etch-a-sketch project today and managed to make it functional with mouse over. Thinking about adding a scale for selecting a grid size and a darkening hover option.

## R1D5
I added an input range slider and some buttons to my etch-a-sketch project. So far, it can only generate random colors and erase grid cells. Need to add options to select own color and a darken feauture.

## R1D6
I learned how to use Vercel to deploy a constellations React application.

## R1D7
It took me a while to figure out how to darken grid cells with mouseover, but I figured out how to use the filter property's brightness value to accomplish my goal. I also struggled with getting only one event listener to be active at a time. I ended up using a switch statement to evaluate the textContent of the button clicked, and it works now. Need to add a color picker, then I'll probably start working on another project.

## R1D8
I started working on a flashcards project for users to create study decks to study from. So far, I figured out how to display each deck added, but I need to figure out how to edit the contents of each deck/dard and/or delete them.

## R1D9
I figured out how to get flashcards to delete and how to add more. Having trouble with rerendering once a card is deleted or added. The useEffect hook renders in an endless loop when I add a state dependency.
