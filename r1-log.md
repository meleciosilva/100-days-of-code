The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 9, Tuesday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
I updated my VA Breweries project. Worked on adding functional pagination buttons. Struggled with making it work with a seach input, but I figured it out.

### R1D2
I continued to work on my VA Breweries project. I added another button to search for breweries on google maps and added a dropdown for sorting listings by name, city, and type. So far, I have the sortByName function working for a single page. I need to figure out how to keep the listings sorted when navigating to other pages.

### R1D3
I figured out how to keep the brewery listings sorted by name, city, and/or type when navigating to other pages. I think I might eventually add another page to see all breweries on a map.

## R1D4
I started an etch-a-sketch project today and managed to make it functional with mouse over. Thinking about adding a scale for selecting a grid size and a darkening hover option.

## R1D5
I added an input range slider and some buttons to my etch-a-sketch project. So far, it can only generate random colors and erase grid cells. Need to add options to select own color and a darken feauture.

## R1D6
I learned how to use Vercel to deploy a constellations React application.

## R1D7
It took me a while to figure out how to darken grid cells with mouseover, but I figured out how to use the filter property's brightness value to accomplish my goal. I also struggled with getting only one event listener to be active at a time. I ended up using a switch statement to evaluate the textContent of the button clicked, and it works now. Need to add a color picker, then I'll probably start working on another project.

## R1D8
I started working on a flashcards project for users to create study decks to study from. So far, I figured out how to display each deck added, but I need to figure out how to edit the contents of each deck/dard and/or delete them.

## R1D9
I figured out how to get flashcards to delete and how to add more. Having trouble with rerendering once a card is deleted or added. The useEffect hook renders in an endless loop when I add a state dependency.

## R1D10
I worked on the Edit Deck page of my flashcards project. I need to organize my components in a more logical way. The nested components are making things more messy than I would have hoped.

## R1D11
I broke a lot of code today. But it gave me the opportunity to seek out other resources to learn from. Ready to start fresh tomorrow.

## R1D12
I took a break from my flashcards project and updated my website/portfolio. I learned how to make a mixed nav bar andhow to blur an image. I updated my photo, deleted some fluff, added a resume section, and updated styling.

## R1D13
Finally structured my React files in a logical way and fixed my code. Now able to add a card to a deck. Need to add EditCard component and figure out how to re-fetch information when a change is made so the app updates properly.

## R1D14
React Flashcards project is fully functional. Failing a few tests still. And still need to figure out how to get app to leload with current data when adding, editing, and deleting listings.

## R1D15
Making good progress on flashcards project. Everything is functional and I am passing all the tests. Need to do some refactoring to meet project requirements, starting with using the same Form component for adding & editing decks/cards.
https://github.com/meleciosilva/Study-Flashcards/tree/main/src

## R1D16
Finished working on my Flashcards project. Was able to properly share the form component between adding & editing components. Learned about a React error that can occur when a component changes from controlled to uncontrolled when dealing with input values.

## R1D17
Spent some time working on my resume today. Also made some minor tweaks to portfolio. I have some ideas for updating my portfolio. I want to delete some fluff, add skills, and create a more minimalist projects section, possibly with transitions.
